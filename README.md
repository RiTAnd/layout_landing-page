# Landing Page

Hello everyone!
I am a beginner)). I'll not say that it's easy, but I really like it!
And this is my __first step__ in my journey towards a career in web development.

__Landing Page__ was built and styled using `grid`, `BEM` and `SCSS`. 
- when structuring `HTML`files were used nested elements, indentation and line breaks
- styles were implemented using class, id and element selectors (external stylesheets); SCSS Variables are used for main values and placed in a separate file

I have encountered some problems that I have not been able to solve. So I'll be very glad for your advice and help.
